# Abstract:

What we will design is a self management app that is used to remind or help dementia patients with their basic daily tasks such as reminders for hygiene, meals and medication administration. The app would consist of two interfaces one for the patient itself and the other one for the healthcare worker who would be looking upon and maintaining the schedules for the patient. The caretaker can schedule in some reminders for the patient depending upon the daily routine of the patient.
This project is written in Java
